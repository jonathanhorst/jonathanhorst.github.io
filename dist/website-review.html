      <h1>Website Review for E-Commerce Brands</h1>
      <p><strong>Ask yourself: What would you do with 10%, 20% or even 50% more money than you are currently making? (Take a few seconds to daydream.)</strong></p>
      <p>The <strong>Website Review</strong> gives you actionable advice on how you can increase revenue on your website by generating more sales and growing your email list.</p>
      <p>The Website Review focuses on the <em>most important</em> changes you need to make to reach your goals.</p>
      <p>It&#8217;s best to think of new visitors to your website <strong>as drunk sociopaths in a hurry.</strong></p>
      <p>You only have <strong>a few seconds</strong> in which to convince these new visitor to stay on your site, and if you make any part of your site the slightest bit confusing, your new visitor needs only to twitch their thumb to the back button to head back to Google and move on to your competition.</p>
      <p>With so many competing websites, <strong>why would your prospect put up with a less than stellar website?</strong></p>
      <p>That&#8217;s why you need to <strong>design your website with the assumption that every visitor is a crazy, lazy drunk.</strong> That&#8217;s the key to a highly profitable website.</p>
      <p>Let&#8217;s break down our user&#8217;s pathologies and what they mean for us:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>The visitor is a sociopath.</strong> They care only about themselves, so you must write to them. The majority of e-commerce sites talk endlessly in the first person. &#8220;We&#8217;re the number 1 blah blah blah&#8221; Who cares? Talk to your visitor, hold up the mirror, describe them to themselves. I&#8217;m my favorite topic. That&#8217;s true of everyone. So always try to talk to your visitor about themselves. Share with them the value they will gain.</li>
        <li><strong>The visitor is lazy.</strong> If you put any undue restraints or requirements on the user, they will give up and leave your site. Have to click eight times to find your product? I&#8217;m leaving. No clear next step? I quit. Remove every friction point because we&#8217;re just that lazy.</li>
        <li><strong>The visitor is drunk.</strong> Let&#8217;s assume both my reading and decision-making abilities are impaired. Strip away all unnecessary garbage on your site. Make everything big and obvious. Reduce any unnecessary decisions by making those decisions for me in advance through defaults or removing them entirely. Though despite being drunk, visitors are deeply distrustful of you.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>What if your website was your most effective sales person?</h2>
      <p>Is your potential customer actually a crazy, lazy drunk? No, of course not — okay maybe some of them — but if you adopt these extremes as a mindset, and design for them, then <strong>your website will work at its absolute best to convert visitors into customers and leads</strong>.</p>
      <p>For an outstanding experience, you need to meet the needs of your visitors. People, when visiting your website, are goal-driven. They have a pain or need they need solved, and <strong>very little patience for your nonsense.</strong></p>
      <p>If your website meets the needs of your visitors by being <strong>easy-to-use and properly positioned</strong>, it will become <strong>the most effective sales person you have.</strong></p>
      <h2>Learn how to make your website your most effective salesperson</h2>
      <p>Here&#8217;s the problem with web design: it&#8217;s focused too much on design, and not enough on results.</p>
      <p>You may be at a loss when it comes to knowing if your website is set up properly.</p>
      <p>Sure, you may have a great site— a beautiful site with wonderful content— but <strong>does it make you any money for your business?</strong> And if not, then why not, and <strong>how do you fix it?</strong> Even if you wanted to improve your website, most of us are left scratching our heads wondering where to even begin.</p>
      <p><strong>That&#8217;s where I come in.</strong></p>
      <p>I&#8217;ve built and optimized <strong>numerous very successful websites</strong> for myself and my clients over the last six years. I&#8217;ve learned, through experience, <strong>what it takes to build a website</strong> that doesn&#8217;t just look good, one that <strong>actually gets results.</strong></p>

      <p>A Website Review is an excellent way to identify the top changes to make to your site to improve your conversion rate, retention strategy, or lead generation.</p>

        <li>You aren&#8217;t willing to put the time, effort, attention, and energy into implementing the advice yourself</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you don&#8217;t have a website, feel free to order a <em>Website Review</em> and save it for when you do have a website.</p>
